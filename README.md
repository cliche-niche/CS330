This repository contains design exercises/assignment submissions made in the course CS330A (2022-23 I Sem.) in a team of four (Team Name: amogOS; Team Members: [Samarth Arora](https://github.com/Samadeol), [Soham Samaddar](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto), [Sarthak Kohli](https://github.com/SARTHAK811), and me, [Aditya Tanwar](https://github.com/cliche-niche)).

The assignments required us to implement programs in the xv6 OS evironment, and consequently do not have a directory of their own, rather a `.md` describing the programs that were asked to implement.

+ [Assignment#1-Part A](./Assignments/A1-A.md): Implement user programs which use syscalls like `getpid()`, `fork()`, `pipe()`, etc.
+ [Assignment#1-Part B](./Assignments/A1-B.md): Implement syscalls like `getppid()`, `waitpid()`, custom implementation of `fork()`, process info, etc.
+ [Assignment#1-Report](./Reports/A1.pdf): Contains a brief description of the `syscall`s implemented in Part B of Assignment 1.

#### Acknowledgements
Most of the [xv6-riscv](./xv6-riscv/) directory was provided to us, we do not take credit for it. We have only made some minor changes/added new programs to it as part of our assignments, and they have been listed in markdown files included in the repository.
