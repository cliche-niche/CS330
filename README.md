This repository contains design exercises/assignment submissions made in the course CS330A (2022-23 I Sem.) in a team of four ([Samarth Arora](https://github.com/Samadeol), [Soham Samaddar](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto), [Sarthak Kohli](https://github.com/SARTHAK811), and [me](https://github.com/cliche-niche)).
