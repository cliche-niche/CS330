This repository contains design exercises/assignment submissions made in the course CS330A (2022-23 I Sem.) in a team of four ([Samarth Arora](https://github.com/Samadeol), [Soham Samaddar](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto), [Sarthak Kohli](https://github.com/SARTHAK811), and [me](https://github.com/cliche-niche)).

The assignments required us to implement programs in the xv6 OS evironment, and consequently do not have a directory of their own, rather a `.md` describing the programs that were asked to implement.

#### Acknowledgements
Most of the [xv6-riscv](./xv6-riscv/) directory was provided to us, we do not take credit for it. We have only made some minor changes/added new programs to it as part of our assignments, and they have been listed in markdown files included in the repository.
